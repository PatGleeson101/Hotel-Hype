# Hotel-Hype
 A text-based python game about running a hotel.
 Feel free to download, play, learn from and extend the game. This version is my Year 10 DigiTech assignment.
 Note that the game will create five .txt files in whatever location it is stored when it is run there for the first time.

## How it works
The goal of Hotel Hype is to constantly grow your meagre starting hotel into a bigger, busier, more profitable place. As a menu-based game, every action is selected from a menu, by entering the corresponding option number. For example:

      **Main menu:
       1) New game
       2) Load save
       3) Quit
      > *1* **
      
...is how you should begin after running the game for the first time.
