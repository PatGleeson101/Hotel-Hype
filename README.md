# Hotel-Hype
 A text-based python game about running a hotel.
 Feel free to download, play, learn from and extend the game. This version is my Year 10 DigiTech assignment.
 Note that the game will create five .txt files in whatever location it is stored when it is run there for the first time.

## How it works
The goal of Hotel Hype is to constantly grow your meagre starting hotel into a bigger, busier, more profitable place. Of course, this means earning and spending your money well. As a menu-based game, every action is selected from a menu, by entering the corresponding option number. For example:

      Main menu:
       1) New game
       2) Load save
       3) Quit
      > 1
      
This is how you should begin after running the game for the first time. After starting your hotel, each passing day will see guests check in and out, jobs be undertaken, amenities be used, rooms become dirty, and advertising take effect. At the end of each day you will be presented with a list of options for making changes. You can choose to explore however many of these options you like, after which you can initiate the next day. Some of the things you can do in the game are:

* Build new rooms
* Upgrade rooms with appliances
* Build amenities
* Hire employees for your amenities
* Buy advertising
* View current rooms, employees, advertisements, amenities and guests, as well as their stats.

Good luck and may your hotel endeavours be ever profitable!
